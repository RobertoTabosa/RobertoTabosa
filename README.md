## Hi there 👋,
I'm Roberto Tabosa.
I have a degree in Computer Science and have been working for several years as a project manager for software development teams. Every day, I learn more about how to lead teams to successfully deliver their projects. Recently, I have dedicated myself to deepening my technical knowledge in two areas: Machine Learning and automated testing.

Postgraduate Degrees:
✅ Software Product Management: Methods and techniques for conducting software product creation.
✅ Agile Project Management: Emphasis on agile methodologies and frameworks for project management.
✅ Master's Degree in Computer Science: Emphasis on Data Mining with AI using multilayer perceptron neural networks.
✅ Information Technology: Focus on object-oriented development and object-oriented databases.

🏆 Latest Github Public Repositories that I built and worth seeing.
 * https://github.com/RobertoTabosa/Playwright.    This project marks the beginning of my studies in automated testing with Playwright and JavaScript.
 * https://github.com/RobertoTabosa/AgriProject.   This is a project using Machine Learning and GIS visualization to understand the best areas for cropping Oats in Manitoba and       Saskatchewan.
   
👯 I’m looking to collaborate with technology teams that strive for exceptional deliveries.
