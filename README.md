## Hi there 👋,

I'm Roberto Tabosa.

I have a degree in Computer Science and have been working for several years as a project manager for software development teams. Every day, I learn more about how to lead teams to successfully deliver their projects. Recently, I have dedicated myself to deepening my technical knowledge in two areas: Machine Learning and automated testing.

Postgraduate Degrees:</br>
✅ Software Product Management: Methods and techniques for conducting software product creation.</br>
✅ Agile Project Management: Emphasis on agile methodologies and frameworks for project management.</br>
✅ Master's Degree in Computer Science: Emphasis on Data Mining with AI using multilayer perceptron neural networks.</br>
✅ Information Technology: Focus on object-oriented development and object-oriented databases.</br>

🏆 Latest Github Public Repositories that I built and worth seeing.</br>
 * https://github.com/RobertoTabosa/Playwright.    This project marks the beginning of my studies in automated testing with Playwright and JavaScript.</br>
 * https://github.com/RobertoTabosa/AgriProject.   This is a project using Machine Learning and GIS visualization to understand the best areas for cropping Oats in Manitoba and       Saskatchewan.</br>
   
👯 I’m looking to collaborate with technology teams that strive for exceptional deliveries.</br>
